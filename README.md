# A Standalone Desktop Additive Synth

This is a side project i am working on, it is a continuation/redesign of a previous project of mine. The end goal is to have it be a full polyphonic additive synth, since additive synths are super cool and there aren't enough of them around. Currently, it is just a sine wave with an ADSR envelope.

## To Use:

Just plug in a midi controller and run the app! Currently it's a little janky, and it will *only* run if a midi controller is plugged in.
